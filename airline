AIRCRAFT (AID: INTEGER, ANAME: STRING, CRUISINGRANGE: INTEGER) 
CERTIFIED (EID: INTEGER, AID: INTEGER) 
EMPLOYEES (EID: INTEGER, ENAME: STRING, SALARY: INTEGER)

Q1.Find the names of aircraft such that all pilots certified to operate them earn more than $80,000.
SELECT ANAME 
FROM AIRCRAFT A, EMPLOYEES E, CERTIFIED C 
WHERE A.AID = C.AID 
  AND E.EID = C.EID 
  AND E.SALARY > 80000;

Q2.b) For each pilot who is certified for more than three aircraft, find the eid and the maximum cruisingrange of the aircraft for which she or he is certified.
  SELECT E.EID, MAX(CRUISINGRANGE) 
FROM EMPLOYEES E, CERTIFIED C, AIRCRAFT A 
WHERE E.EID = C.EID 
  AND A.AID = C.AID 
GROUP BY E.EID 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

Q3.c) For all aircraft with cruisingrange over 1000 miles, find the name of the aircraft and the average salary of all pilots certified for this aircraft.
  SELECT A.ANAME, AVG(SALARY) 
FROM EMPLOYEES E, CERTIFIED C, AIRCRAFT A 
WHERE C.EID = E.EID 
  AND A.AID = C.AID 
  AND A.CRUISINGRANGE > 1000 
GROUP BY A.ANAME;

Q4.d) Print the enames of pilots who can operate planes with cruising range greater than 3000 miles but are not certified on any Boeing aircraft.
SELECT DISTINCT E.ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEES E
JOIN CERTIFIED C ON E.EID = C.EID
JOIN AIRCRAFT A ON C.AID = A.AID
WHERE A.CRUISINGRANGE > 3000
  AND E.EID NOT IN (
    SELECT C2.EID
    FROM CERTIFIED C2
    JOIN AIRCRAFT A2 ON C2.AID = A2.AID
    WHERE A2.ANAME = 'BOEING'
  );

5Q.e) Print the name and salary of every nonpilot whose salary is more than the average salary for pilots.
SELECT EID, ENAME, SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE SALARY > (
  SELECT AVG(SALARY)
  FROM EMPLOYEES
  WHERE EID IN (
    SELECT EID
    FROM CERTIFIED
  )
)
AND EID NOT IN (
  SELECT EID 
  FROM CERTIFIED
);
